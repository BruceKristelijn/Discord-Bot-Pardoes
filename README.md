# Discord-Bot-Pardoes
A discord bot for me and my friends' server. Just some sloppy Node js code as a proof of concept. 

I have plans of actually expanding using json to allow for dynamic commands and maybe easier to submit commands and dynamic commands.

<h2>Planned commands and features:</h2>

<b>pardoes [audiofile]</b> - plays a audiofile in the initializer's channel.<br>
<b>pardoes addaudiofile [name]</b> - Adds a audiofile. Audio file as attachment to message(?).<br>
<b>pardoes removeaudiofile [name]</b> - Uses the name parameter to remove audio from it's memory.<br>
<b>pardoes oldmeme</b> - Gets and extremely old meme from memes channel. <br>
<b>pardoes setting memechannel [id]</b> - Changes the channel ID for the memes. <br>
<b>pardoes setting quotechannel [id]</b> - Changes the channel ID for the quote. <br>
